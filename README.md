# nodeblog
A blog app with static view partials served up using Node, Express and Angular.

This is a work in progress and I fully realize that many options for this same sort of thing are available already. It's more fun to do things for myself and learn Node in the process.

The current version under the master branch is incomplete but should contain a code that is in good working order and that compiles.

If you would like to see the work in progress that may not actually compile, checkout the dev branch (literally and figuratively).

Enjoy.
