        No, I don't imagine that I fit that description per se, but I have always
        liked the sound of that phrase. If you don't catch the reference, then let your
        fingers do the walking. If I stumped you yet again with that whole "fingers-walking" thing, then you were likely
        born after 2000 (see, we used to have these things called "phone books", and well...never mind).
        Basically, "Sweaty-Toothed Madman" doesn't mean anything in this context. Or in any context, for that matter.
        It means whatever you think it means.

        I have made several aborted attempts to blog regularly over the years. These attempts were generally accompanied by
        some vague promise to myself and the world about how often I was going to post. This time, I'm not making any such promise.
        I'm going to write whenever the spirit moves me. Hopefully, the spirit will move me about once per week. If not...oh, well.

        I did do some anonymous blogging once upon a time. I was quite prolific (generally daily!) and actually developed a bit
        of a loyal following in certain circles. I will probably resurrect some of the better pieces I did back then, if I can manage
        to figure out how to log back into the Wordpress.com site that I was using in those days.
