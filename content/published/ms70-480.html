    	As mentioned in my previous post, I've been studying for the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/learning/en-us/exam-70-480.aspx" target="_blank">Microsoft Exam MS 70-480, Programming in HTML5 with JavaScript and CSS3</a>. I bought the Microsoft Press study guide of the same title and have been going through all of the examples included in the book. Because I learn more by doing than I do by rote memorization, I have been typing out all of the examples by hand.
    </p>
    <p>
    	I've put the resultant code in <a href="https://github.com/tqheel/ms70-480" target="_blank">this Github repository</a> in case anyone else might find it useful in their study efforts.
