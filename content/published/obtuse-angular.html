	<p>I've been learning the <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJS</a> JavaScript framework.</p>
	<p>Man, it is super cool. The learning curve is pretty steep, but I'm getting there. A week ago, I was in the dark. Now, I would say that there is a dim, yellowish, oven-light-sized bulb starting to glow in my brain. That's progress. Check in with me in a couple of weeks. Maybe a nightstand lamp light will be lit up by then.

	<p>I can't say exactly why my brain is having such difficulty <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok" target="_blank">grokking</a> Angular. I think it probably has something to do with the many months of time that I have spent writing JS code with jQuery. I have a deep love for jQuery, so I suppose it is an affront to my sensibilities to throw that whole paradigm out the window. And I mean way...out. Angular is an entirely new and wonderful cup of tea.</p>
	<p>As I mentioned in a previous post, this site has some Angularness to it. For now it's mainly the URL routing, navigation and for swapping out content dynamically. I will probably add some animations and maybe a pop-out menu for navigating to single blog posts directly.</p>
