        This site is a labor of love, driven by a labor of hate for CMSs.
    </p>
	<p>
		I've dabbled with every content management and blog system known to man, and my conclusion is that 
		they are all a pain in the ass. Authentication schemes...connection strings...schema changes...security patches...plug-ins. 
		It never ends. It's a slow death by a thousand paper cuts.
	</p>
	<p>
		I even started to build my own ASP.Net MVC blog engine once. Nope. Still too many moving parts.
	</p>
    <p>
		I still wanted to hand-craft my own blogging solution, so here were my criteria:
		<ul>
			<li>Client-side code only</li>
			<li>No database</li>
			<li>No authentication scheme</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		I know that there are a myriad of solutions that fit these criteria, but again, I wanted to do it myself for the fun of it. 
		I like reinventing the wheel. Here is what I came up with:
		<ul>
			<li>A Bootstrap CSS theme: <a href="http://startbootstrap.com" target=_blank>Grayscale</a></li>
			<li>A Single Page Application architecture using the <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> JavaScript framework</li>
			<li>Three or four static HTML files</li>
			<li>Deploy new posts to MS Azure as static HTML partials using Git</li>
			<li>Serenity (the literal meaning of the word, not some fancy JavaScript framework)</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>Pardon my retro, monochrome styling. I was feeling nostalgic for those late nights of my early teens, where I was getting 
	closely acquainted with my Apple ][c.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm quite happy with it, to start. When I have a chance to rip out my personal content, I'm going to post the code 
		to my <a href="https://github.com/tqheel">Github</a> account. It's nothing spectacular, but it is blissfully simple.
	</p>
	<p>It's not done, though. It will never be done. What fun would "done" be?</p>
