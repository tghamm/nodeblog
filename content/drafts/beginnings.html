        I've been listening to Shawn Wildermuth's <i><a href="http://wildermuth.com/hwpod">Hello World Podcast</a></i> recently, and it has caused me to think about my own early
        experiences with computers. Many of the people Shawn has interviewed are about my age, and I have found a lot of commonality
        between the interviewees' experiences with programming in the early 1980s and my own.

        In my "About" page, I refer to my genesis as a programmer somewhere around 1982.  I probably had some exposure a year or
        so before that with a TRS-80 (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80#Model_III" target="_blank">probably a Model III</a>),
        to which I had access through my math class in middle school. Today, many people refer to those TRS-80 machines as "Trash 80s", but
        you will never hear that phrase come out of my mouth. In those early days of the 1980s, those TRS-80 machines with a 5 1/4"
        floppy drive cost about $1,700 (enough to buy many people a very reliable car back then) and I would have done nearly anything
        to have one at home. My classmates were only interested in typing swear words and other obscene phrases into the
        <a href="https://archive.org/stream/Eliza_1979_Tandy#page/n7/mode/2up" target="_blank">Eliza</a>
        program to see how she would respond. Admittedly, that was good for quite a few laughs, but I spent many hours during lunch
        and after school sitting in that classroom and experimenting and writing programs in BASIC. I was alone in this endeavor, which was
        just fine by me. For me that machine was the Holy Grail.
